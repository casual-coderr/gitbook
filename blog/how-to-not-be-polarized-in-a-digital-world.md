# How to not be polarized in a digital world

### So what is polarization again ?

Polarized thought is something you knowingly or unknowingly get into most of the time. It requires a constant effort not to get polarized. I learnt it from the book “Think again”.&#x20;

So Think of your favourite football or a basketball team, have you ever thought something bad should happen to the player of the other team ?

Do you find it difficult to listen to an interview by the opposing political party ?

If you answered yes to anything of the above, then you are polarized.

### What's the cause of this ?

While polarization is not a new thing, but with the advent of internet and companies putting profits over human well-being, you are being fed what you want to hear to increase watch time and app engagement. Suppose you like cats and don't like dogs, social media only feeds you posts related to cats and why there are the 'best thing' that can happen to humans. On the other side, people who like dogs will only get feeds and news about dogs. But social media is not real life, so when you meet your friend who likes a dog, you not only overreact to that situation, but will mostly start to dislike the friend just because he has a dog. While this example might sound silly in real life, but change the cat and dog to two opposing political parties or two top sports teams, and then you get the picture.

### What can be done ?

I would suggest reading the book “Think Again” by Adam Grant. In future i will update this post with simple to do techniques.
