# More than Just Numbers !!

Renewable energy is often touted as the solution to the world's energy needs. However, it's important to delve beyond the raw numbers of installed capacity and look at the actual energy production. The installed capacity numbers may be impressive, but they don't always tell the full story.

For instance, a wind turbine with a 100% capacity factor (meaning it is always producing at its maximum output) would produce more energy than a wind turbine with a 30% capacity factor, even if the latter had a higher installed capacity. In addition, other factors such as maintenance and location can greatly impact a renewable energy source's actual energy production.

Let's take wind turbines as an example. They are often placed in areas with high wind speeds to maximize energy production, but even in these areas, turbines can be down for maintenance or repairs. Additionally, some turbines may be located in areas with lower wind speeds, leading to lower energy production. This means that while a wind farm may have a high installed capacity, its actual energy production may vary significantly.

Looking at actual energy production rather than just installed capacity can provide a more accurate picture of the effectiveness of renewable energy sources. For example, in Denmark, wind energy production accounted for 47% of the country's total electricity consumption in 2019. Meanwhile, the UK set a new record in 2020, generating 30% of its electricity from wind power alone. By focusing on actual energy production rather than just installed capacity, we can gain a better understanding of the impact renewable energy sources are having on our energy needs.

Ultimately, the goal of renewable energy is to provide sustainable and reliable energy production. Therefore, it's important to consider not just the raw numbers of installed capacity but also the actual energy production of these sources. This approach will help us to accurately assess the potential of renewable energy and guide us towards a sustainable future.

One example of the importance of looking at actual energy production can be seen in the small town of Georgetown, Texas. In 2015, the town became one of the first in the United States to transition to 100% renewable energy sources. However, Georgetown did not achieve this feat simply by installing enough wind turbines and solar panels to match its energy needs. Rather, the town carefully considered its energy usage and created a system that allowed it to effectively store and distribute renewable energy. This approach ensured that Georgetown was able to consistently meet its energy needs using only renewable sources, rather than relying on backup sources during periods of low energy production.

In conclusion, while installed capacity numbers can be impressive, they don't always tell the full story when it comes to renewable energy. By focusing on actual energy production, we can gain a better understanding of the potential of these sources and the impact they are having on our energy needs. Whether it's a small town like Georgetown or an entire country like Denmark or the UK, the success of renewable energy ultimately depends on its ability to provide reliable and sustainable energy production.
