## What ?

Best Of the Dns Resolving servers as it blocks malware and phishing sites out of the box and is based on Switzerland and have independently audited results showing they don't log user info.

Note: Just because a service is based in Switzerland does not mean to close your eyes and use it and think you are protected from everything. Do your due diligence and research about the service. But the general norm is swiss have a pretty strict privacy laws so you can be assured you are better off than a service from a US company.&#x20;
